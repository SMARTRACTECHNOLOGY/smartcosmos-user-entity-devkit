### 13.	NO SET-OFF

Except as otherwise provided in this EULA, no Party shall be entitled to set-off any claims it may have under this EULA against any claims any other Party may have under this EULA unless the rights or claims of the Party claiming a right of set-off are not disputed or have been confirmed by final decision of a competent court or arbitral tribunal or – if claimed in legal proceedings – a decision on the rights and claims of the Party can be taken in the last oral hearing.

### 14.	NO WAIVER

The failure of SMARTRAC to exercise or enforce any rights or provisions of this EULA will not constitute a waiver of such rights or provisions.

### 15.	FOREIGN TRADE REGULATIONS

Objects, documentation and other materials are subject to the export control laws of various countries, including but not limited to the laws of Germany and the United States. Licensee shall comply with all applicable export and import laws, regulations, and associated embargo and sanction regulations, including prohibitions on export for certain end uses or certain end users.

### 16.	CHOICE OF LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement shall be governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. Exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes regarding rights and duties under this EULA, including its validity shall be New York City, New York.

### 17.	SEVERABILITY

Should one or more provisions of this EULA be or become invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this EULA. The same shall apply if the EULA does not contain an essential provision. In lieu of the invalid or unenforceable provision, or to fill a contractual lacuna, such valid and enforceable provision shall apply which reflects as closely as possible the commercial intention of the Parties as regards the invalid, unenforceable or missing provision.
